    "Every Gym environment should contain the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `env.step(action)` To advance the environment by one time step through applying `action`. Will return four things: `observation, reward, done, info`, wherein `done` is a boolean value indicating whether this **episode** is finished. `info` is a dict containing some information the user is interested in.\n",
    "2. `env.reset()` To reset the environment, back to the initial state. Will return the initial observation of the new episode.\n",
    "3. `env.render()` To render the current state of the environment for human-being\n",
    "4. `env.action_space` The allowed action format. In our case, it is `Discrete(4)` which means the action is an integer in the range [0, 1, 2, 3]. Therefore the `action` for `step(action)` should obey the limit of the action space.\n",
    "5. `env.observation_space` The observation space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the word **episode** means the process that an agent interacts with the environment from the initial state to the terminal state. Within one episode, the agent will only receive one `done=True`, when it goes to the terminal state (the agent is dead or the game is over).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use `FrozenLake8x8-v1` as our environment. In this environment, the agent controls the movement of a *character* in a grid world. Some tiles of the grid are walkable, and others are not, making to the agent falling into the water. Additionally, the movement direction of the agent is uncertain and only partially depends on the chosen direction. The agent is rewarded for finding a walkable path to a goal tile. The meaning of each character:\n",

    "1. S : starting point, safe\n",

    "1. Yes. Value iteration evaluates the policy and then for each state, it takes the maximum action value to be the estimated state. Hence, between iterations, since the state values have not converged, it is common to see that some iterations during training yield better rewards.\n",
    "2. The impact of the discount factor gamma indicates that rewards received in future time steps are worth \"gamma\" times than what it would be if it were received immediately. \n",
    "3. Policy iteration would technically take an infinite number of iterations to converge to the optimal v*. Therefore, the value function convergence criterion epsilon enables training to stop once the value function changes by only a small about during an iteration."
